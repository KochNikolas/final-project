Our Application consists of 4 Scenes. First of all, the Main Lobby and then 3 Subscenes, each one containing a separate Minigame. After starting the Application you will spawn in the Main Lobby which offers you to choose one of the three minigames.

First Minigame (Aim Trainer): The player will appear in the middle of 20 randomly generated targets with a weapon in his hand. The goal is to shoot all 20 targets as fast as possible. After destroying the last target the timer in the upper right corner will stop and display the previous best time. The player gets two Buttons to restart the game or return to the Main Lobby.

Second Minigame (Visual Memory): The player spawns in front of a gameboard displaying a 3 by 3 grid with place for cubes in it. After 10 seconds the gameboard will start to play a 5-piece long sequence by letting one cube glow up at a time. After the gameboard plays the sequence, the player has to grab cubes (stored on his right side) and place them in the sequence order into the grid. When he fails, the current cube will turn red and the game will start up again, until the player passes the game. After passing, the player will be teleported back to the Main Lobby. Besides that, the player has the opportunity to leave the scene anytime by grabbing the Main Lobby Button on his left side.

Third Minigame (Reaction Test): The player spawns in a tiny room with red walls, the game starts immediately. The game waits two to five seconds to rapidly recolor the room red and spawn a target in a 360 degree radius around the player. The game will stop the exact time in milliseconds until the player hits the target. After hitting, the game shows the time and previous best time. The Scene contains a button to restart the game and one to get back to the Main Lobby immediately.
